## Overview
A FastAPI service for per-user document storage with JWT authentication, S3-compatible storage, and AWS cloud deployment. Users can register, authenticate, and manage their documents through a RESTful API with presigned URLs for secure file access.

## What I Built
RESTful API with FastAPI for user authentication and document management. JWT-based authentication system with secure token handling Per-user document storage with unique filename enforcement. Presigned URL generation for secure file downloads and complete AWS cloud infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipeline. API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration (this part was generated by FastAPI).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend** - Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Database** - PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- **Storage** - S3-compatible object storage
- **Authentication** - JWT tokens
- **Cloud** - AWS (ECS Fargate, ECR, ALB, WAF, S3, RDS)
- **DevOps** - Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Testing** - Pytest, LocalStack for S3 testing

## Key Features

- **Secure Document Isolation** - Per-user document storage with unique filename enforcement
- **JWT Authentication** - Token-based authentication for all API endpoints
- **Presigned URLs** - Automatic generation for secure file downloads
- **DDoS Protection** - Rate limiting and security via AWS WAF
- **Automated Deployment** - CI/CD pipeline with container registry
- **API Documentation** - Comprehensive testing suite and OpenAPI docs
- **Scalable Architecture** - Cost-effective cloud infrastructure

## What I Learned

I learned how to integrate different AWS services together to deploy a secure RESTful API, cloud architecture design, FastAPI development, implementing CI/CD pipelines with automated testing. Database design and migration management with SQLAlchemy/Alembic and security considerations for remote file storage. I also learned how to optimise cost when it comes to deploying applications using the cloud.
